# GCode Package

**DEPRECATED**

This package has been split into two more focused packages:

1. **GCodeProcessor** - For processing and enhancing existing G-code
2. **GCodeGenerator** - For generating new G-code from processed data

Please use those packages instead.

The original code has been preserved in the GCode_Deprecated directory.
